From the results we see that there is two situtations in which adding the threads to the program is actually faster than going through the directories recursively. The results for system 2 demonstrate that adding threads doesn't make the work go faster. This is because it has to create extra overheard for simple function execution. System 3 demonstrate that an improper usage of threads will substantionally slow the down the process. System 4 and system 5 show that an optimal usage of theads will speed up the program substantionally. However, even though system 4 and system 5 demosntrate a substansial improvement with speed, it still shows that proper usage of threads will speed up the program. System 4 demonstrates a much faster average time compare to system 5. While system 5 creates mores threads compare to system 4, system 4 is much faster because it uses the thread on intensive work. Opening a directory and going through its content is fast enough on its own and doesn't really need a thread to open it.
